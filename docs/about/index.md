The definition of money has changed over years and it is very important for an individual to have knowledge on Money management as no one wants their hard earned money to be wasted. Along with the lecture "Introduction to Software Engineering for Engineers" at Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg , our team "Team Machine" will develop an app for Android OS on "Money Control" that can keep track of one's expenses and notify them when they cross the budget limit.
