**Welcome** to our team’s first blog. In this blog we will introduce our Team, Project and our motivations.


## Our Project:

The project we will be working on is ‘Money Control’. About 60-70% people are not sure of how their money is spent and they end up broke by the end of the month. So, Money management is as important as earning money for every individual. And developing an app which can monitor earnings and expenses will help one to plan financially better and save them from not wasting their hard earned money.

## Goals:

Our objective is to develop a app that can enable user to give his earnings manually and keep track of his savings and spendings based on the requirement. In this way user can be able to restrain himself from spending the money on the things that matter him the least. We also intend to provide the statistics of his expenses on monthly basis.

## Our Team and Motivations

We are the team of four from different backgrounds with very limited knowledge of computer science. Currently we all are studying Digital Engineering.

* **Ahmed Elkhouly** : Implementing an Android App for the first time will develop my skills and will help me a lot to convert my ideas into real applications that would help others.

* **Muralidhar Reddy** : I was really fascinated to see few lines of code helping in providing solutions for many problems in various sectors and that has made to move towards Computer Science and I am hoping to gain knowledge on programming and improve my skills.

* **Nishad Pawaskar** : Android plays an important role in the process of Digitalisation. This course allows me to get into the insights of the Android app development and how to develop your team to improve your business.

* **Pranay Teja** : I always wanted to learn computer programming, I think this course helps me not only to learn programming but also to develop an android app with that.

## Complimentary Skills

We are from various backgrounds having different skill sets and together we think we can achieve our objective. This brings out  various  soft skills like analytical skills, Presentation, Management, Inter-personal skills, creativity etc. through which the team will be able to deliver the product in a timely and systematic manner to the customer. As none of us have worked on developing an app before, we 	look forward to learn the required skiils and collaborate effectively to complete the task on time.

## Roles and Responsibilities

We tend to distribute the roles in a flexible manner and everyone is encouraged to take up any role during the development. But initially,

* **Ahmed Elkhouly and Nishad pawaskar**:  Design and Implementation 

* **Muralidhar Reddy** : Maintain Blog content and Testing

* **Pranay Teja**: Team Management, Documentation and Testing

## Communication

“If you communicate, you can just get by. If you communicate effectively, you can make wonders”.

Right from forming a team and gathering requirements till the final phase, proper communication between the members is very crucial and since all four of us have met in the context of course and so, it will be a challenge initially. 

* We will use messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp.

* We have team meetings twice a week to discuss the progress of the project.

* We are using GitHub to share, merge and update our work and also slack for communication.

## Flexibility

The work is shared between two members initially and everyone can move into any desired role during the course of the project and improve their skills. So, whenever there is any new requiremnt from the customer we will analyze them and take decisions accordingly.
