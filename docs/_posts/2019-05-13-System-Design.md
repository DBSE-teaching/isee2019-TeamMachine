**Welcome again!**

This is our third blog on our way in developing the app and we are going to present you the activity diagrams, class diagrams and explanation for each class and attribute. 

So, right after gathering requirements we had to think about the user interface, logic and most importantly programming part. We had a meeting to discuss the UI part and after eliminating a lot of designs, we finally fixed on one which was not more complex for the programmers. System Design process involves describing the modules, interfaces, data and architecture of the app. We have created activity diagrams based on the user stories.

## Activity Diagrams

These diagrams gives a pictorial representation of work flows from one activity to another. So, they basically shows the operations performed when user clicks on the certain buttons.

## Class Diagram

These diagrams shows the different aspects for evolving the code for the application by viewing the classes, attributes and relationships among the objects that are used in developing the code. This make the code readable and extensible.

## Development Strategy

We have quickly started with the implementation of the application since we were asked to submit the basic prototype by mid May. We assigned tasks through slack and GitHub and the progress was always tracked by scrum master and reviewed the same during our meetings that happened twice in a week.The time for designing each user story was estimated and we will try to finish it without any deadline slip. In each sprint, a steady progress is always mandatory which helps in predicting that the end product completion happens in time. As of now, we will follow the software prototyping method along with continuous integration which means that incomplete developments of the end product will happen along with merging of all development copies to a common repository.

* Sprint 1 - We had grouped the total layout creation and login page for the user with a time frame of one week and we have completed it. 

* Sprint 2 - We created the home page and provided the options for the user to enter the income manually and now were in the phase of creating the page for expenses.

* Sprint 3 - Database integration and programming activity and the other extra features will be performed as a apart of third sprint and complete the entire development of the app.

* Sprint 4- We are planning to do the unit and integration testing once the entire app is developed and projected time frame is mid June.

## Prototype

And we are ready with the basic prototype of the app.
