**Hello People!**

Welcome to one of the final part of the blog as we have made it to th end of the course. Nothing goes perfect without any issue and in this blog we will give a glance of challenges we faced, benefits we encountered as team and our experience while developing the app. 

## Technical Challenges encountered

We faced a few technical challenges with the implementation part of our app Celedger.

* Coding in Java : As members of our team were from diversified engineering backgrounds,none of our group members was familiar with java. So, the large portion of time was put in to understand everything from the scratch. But the support that every individual provided within helped to bridge the knowledge gap.

* Using Android studio : In the beginning it was a challenge to get familiar with android studio and understand each and every option. We had some issues while developing the initial pages of the app. Also, running an android emulator takes a lot of time general.

* Coding conventions : We didn't have prior knowledge on conventions that should be used and the importance of them. It was completely new for us. Also, it was quite difficult to ensure that every member of our team is following the coding conventions correctly.

* Understanding the requirements : Every individual's perspective won't be same. So, we had some issues in understanding the requirements before proceeding to implementation. We developed one functionality with wrong understanding but changed at end.

* Integrating code in GitHub : We had some problems while updating code on gitHub and making it available in the blog in the intial phase of the development.

## Challenges experienced by working as a team

Working as a team was a great experience overall as it was first project for few, but there were some challenges as well.

* Assigning tasks : We were not sure of what tast everyone should do as the knowledge possessed was limited and different tasks in the app development were having different difficulty levels. As the work should be divided equally, it was bit challenging to maintain uniform workload.

* Too many ideas : Well,it's always beneficial if everyone contributes but whenever we had a problem, we always had more than two solutions within the team. Choosing the right idea was always difficult. 

* Misunderstanding the requirements :- Each member in the team made seperate notes from the requirement analysis. When we discussed it with in the group, we had different opionions which ultimately put us in some state of enigma. So, the next meeting with customer was entirely focussed on solving the confusion.

* Group meetings :- Our group members are in different semesters, doing different subjects, part time jobs, projects and so on. Finding a common time slot for internal meetings were a bit difficult for us.
