**Hello Folks!** 

To start with the development of any application, one has to analyse the requirements procured from the customer and this blog contains the various phases that were involved in requirement analysis for our app. 


## Requirement Gathering

So, after deciding to develop an app on Money Control each individual in the group was very curious to know what customer wants as there are few such apps available in market. We had three meetings with the user in and the customer has specified his app requirements in general during the first meeting. Each member has noted down the customer needs in their own understanding and they were consolidated later. We even asked him if he needs any extra features and improvements in the specifications, but the customer showed us that he knows what he wants and suggested that the extra features can be added later if he feels the need for them.


## Requirement Analysis

It is a fact that everyone’s perception is not same. So, we had a meeting to check on the contradictions and ambiguities in the gathered requirements and consolidate them in a easy and understandable way by removing redundancies . With this, we got a clear idea on what was expected form us. We started preparing user stories right after our first meeting with the customer and the questions that were encountered were recorded. We prioritized the uncertainties and customer gave us clear picture during second meeting and also gave some extra requirements.


## Requirement Specification

After gathering all the requirements form the user, we categorized them into 

A)Vital Features

B)Optional Features

## Vital Features

* Protect the data by pin.

* User friendly interface.

* Income should be entered manually and should be modifiable.

* Recurring expenses like rent, subscription fees etc., should be added to expenses automatically.

* Predefined Categories for expenses like fixed and casual etc.,.

* Purpose of each expense and the time at which the money was spent.

* Expenses should be modifiable.

* Keep track of how the payment was done(Via card, cash etc.,)

* Numeric keyboard only while entering amount.

* Filters like By date, By Category and By Payment mode for viewing expenses.

* Mode of payments for recurring expenses.

* Savings should be visible in the app.

## Optional Features

* Set monthly budget.

* Notification on monthly basis.

* Pictorial or graphical representation of the income, expenses and savings.

* User settings for any change of currency.

* Push notification when monthly budget is exceeded.

## User Stories

The user stories were formulated right after the first meeting by stepping into his shoes and making sure they fulfill all the requirements. They were arranged in the priority wise and presented in front of the user. Below are the user stories that were formulated.


## Use Case Diagram  

Use case diagrams defines the functions that the app should perform by using actors and use cases. The below figures denotes a typical use case diagram of our application.

## Requirement Validation

We presented all the user stories and requirements in our third meeting to the customer and some XML pages were also shown. We got a nod from the customer asking us to proceed with the further development of the application.

## Wrong assumptions

* Initially we thought that the app is an online platform so that the bank transactions will be noted down automatically but after meeting with the customer we got to know that he wants to enter data manually.

* We thought that the data should be protected by a password but later customer told he just wants a pin.

## App Logo

Since the customer can keep track of his money via cellphone, we named the app as “CELEDGER”-Cellphone Ledger. And this is our logo:




So, the journey of the requirement analysis comes to end now and we started to focus on the development of app and can’t wait to present you the basic prototype in the next blog. 

Keep following US.
